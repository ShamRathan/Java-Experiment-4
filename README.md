# To display the even numbers from 1-20

## Aim:
  To write a Java program to display the even numbers from 1-20.
  
## Algorithm

Step 1 : Open Intelli J application or any other code editor.

Step 2 : Create a class and name it EvenNumbers.

Step 3 : With declaring iteration variables, also set limits,in this case 1-20.

Step 4 : Write the logic for the program using for loop.

Step 5 : Display the result in the terminal.

## Program:
```

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 2; i <= 20; i += 2) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
    }
}


```




## Output:
